/* @ Redux */
/*
 * Redux through the Redux Library and react-redux together provides a way
 * to distribute data to various components throughout our component hierarchy.
 * It gives us a wayto centralize all of our data inside of a common store.
 * And it also provides some means of changing data inside that store by
 * dispatching action creators, reducers and all kind of stuff).
 */

/* @ Context */
/*
 * With context system by itself, all we really have is a way to distribute data
 * to various components inside of our application i.e A way to communicate from
 * a parent component down to a child.
 */

/* Context system is far more limited than Redux is! */
